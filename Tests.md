## Test Procedure

### 1. Range Test

- **Objective:** Measure the maximum operational range of the device.
- **Distances:**
  - **45m**
  - **85m**
  - **95m**

#### Setup Configurations:
- **Mid-Aligned Setup:** Device and endpoints are aligned directly.
- **Misaligned Setup:** Device and endpoints are at an angle.

#### Steps:
1. For each distance, set up the device at the starting point.
2. Start the wireless stopwatch.
3. Move the device towards the endpoint (either mid-aligned or misaligned).
4. Stop the stopwatch when the device loses connection.
5. Record the distance and time taken.

- **Results:**
  - **Distance (meters):** [Enter Distance]
  - **Time (seconds):** [Enter Time]
  - **Setup Type:** [Mid-Aligned / Misaligned]

### 2. Speed Test

- **Objective:** Measure the speed of the device over specified distances.
- **Distances:** 45m, 85m, 95m

#### Steps:
1. For each distance, set up the device at the starting point.
2. Start the wireless stopwatch.
3. Activate the device and measure the time taken to cover the distance.
4. Stop the stopwatch when the device reaches the endpoint.
5. Record the time taken.

- **Results:**
  - **Distance (meters):** [Enter Distance]
  - **Time (seconds):** [Enter Time]
  - **Speed (m/s):** [Calculate Speed]

### 3. Battery Life Test

- **Objective:** Measure the battery life of the device under continuous operation.
- **Initial Battery Level:** [Enter initial battery percentage]

#### Steps:
1. Fully charge the device.
2. Start the wireless stopwatch.
3. Operate the device continuously until the battery is depleted.
4. Stop the stopwatch when the device shuts down.
5. Record the final battery percentage.

- **Results:**
  - **Total Operating Time (hours):** [Enter Time]
  - **Final Battery Level (%):** [Enter Final Battery Level]
